const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "The second step of the basic process in which the team analyzes the required tools and hardware and operating systems in order to complete the project as well as the client's requirements." 
const design = "UI/UX team designs the look of the product as well as the features."
const implementation = "Web developers implement the design into a viable product."
const testing_integration = "QA team and others test the product searching for bugs or design flaws and then makes it available to the public or whoever it needs to be made available to depending on the function."
